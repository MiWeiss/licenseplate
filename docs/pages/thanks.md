## Thanks

This project relies on a bunch of great projects, amongst which are

* The [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest), used to fetch information about a repositories license.
* The source code of [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com), parsed to get information about 
licenses permissions, conditions and limitations. 
* Icons from [feathericons.com](https://feathericons.com/).
* [Just the docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) template for this page.
