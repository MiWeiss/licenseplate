## Legal Stuff & Co. 

### No Legal Advice, no warranty and no liability

Neither licenseplate nor its developers provide legal advice, 
and licenseplate is provided without any warranty of any kind.
Please consult the corresponding passage in the 
 [MIT license](https://github.com/MiWeiss/licenseplate/blob/main/LICENSE),
under which licenseplate is distributed. 

### (No) Data Collection
Licenseplate does not collect any information to share it with anyone but the user.

An exception to this are of course requests to the github API, which are required 
to collect information about repository licenses. 

User-specific data, such as ignored repositories or cached license information,
has to be stored by licenseplate for proper functioning. 
Such information is partially stored on the users browser local storage (e.g. using `chrome.storage.local`), 
and partially syncronized amongst users devices (e.g. using `chrome.storage.sync`).

For details, please inspect the publicly available source code.

### Github
Obviously, licenseplate is not a product from github.

### Future Changes
All information provided on this page may change, without further notice, in the future.
