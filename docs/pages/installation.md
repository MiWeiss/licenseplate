## Installation

Sooner or later, you will be able to install this from the extension store of your choice on a variety of browsers. 
Before that's set up, feel free to build the application from source (npm run build)
 and manually add it to chrome (extensions -> enable developer mode -> load unpacked).
 
Similarly, you should be able to add it to firefox and edge. 
Safari support is somewhere on my todo list as well :-)
