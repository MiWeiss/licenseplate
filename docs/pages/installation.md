## Installation

### Using a marketplace 
Sooner or later, you will be able to install this from the extension store of your choice on a variety of browsers. 
I'm still working on this, so please be patient :-) 

### Installing it yourself
Using the extensions-developer mode in chrome, firefox or edge, you can add the unpacked licenseplate extension manually (just click on `load unpacked`).
You'll find an unpacked version of licenseplate shipped with the [latest release](https://github.com/MiWeiss/licenseplate/releases), e.g. `v0.2.0-unpacked`, or you can easily build the most recent version by cloning [the sources](https://github.com/MiWeiss/licenseplate) and running `npm run build` (unpacked extension lands in the `dist` folder).
