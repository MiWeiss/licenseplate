## Development & Contributions 

Contibutions are very welcome! 
I particularly invite people having a better flair for style 
 or typescript, and which have the urge to improve what they found in this repo 
<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f607.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>. 
 Before you make a major contribution, it's probably best to first discuss it in an issue.

When implementing a change, please make sure that *licenseplate*
 keeps the number of API requests to a minimum, 
 and don't include any external packages.

### Roadmap
The following is an incomplete list of ideas I'd like to get done sooner or later:

- <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f525.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
    Strengthen test suite (more unit, not just E2E).
- <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2611.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
    Customizable alert levels, based on user-defined license requirements.
- <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4da.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
    Also show licenseplate alerts on popular package indexes (e.g. [pypi.org](https://pypi.org)).
- <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f477.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
    Define remote configs for page-dependent dom-element queries and style info, 
    allowing to quickly react to github page changes.


Additonal ideas or want to work on any of these things? Great!
