## Details for Contributors

Some high level info is given [here](https://miweiss.github.io/licenseplate/development/).

Develop using `npm run watch` and by adding / refreshing the `dist` folder as unpacked extension in the developer mode of `chrome://extension` (or similar on edge / firefox).

### Project Structure

The following are the most relevant folders in this repository. Folders not listed here are hopefully self-explanatory.

â”œâ”€â”€ public                  # Static resources
â”œâ”€â”€ browser_control         # E2E tests and automated image generation for docs. Uses python & selenium
â”œâ”€â”€ dist                    # The extension (built using `npm run build`) ends up here.
â”œâ”€â”€ src                     # Source Files

### Automated Stuff

- **License Generation**\
  Once a week, the CI clones the choosealicense.com sources and uses it to re-generate our license information (`src/__gen__/licenses.json`). Changes are submitted through a PR.\
  The script can be run manually as `npm run gen-licenses`.
  
- **Documentation Image Capturing**\
  To keep the images in our docs up to date with recent style changes of github.com, they are re-generated once a week, or after a push to `main`, and submitted through a PR.\
  The script can be run manually by setting up the selenium environment (`cd browser_control`, creating and activating a python `venv` and runing `pip install -r requirements.txt`) and by then running `python gen_docs_images.py`\
  <sup><sub>Note: Views which require a login, such as the open-issue image, are not yet automatically generated. I have to figure our a way around the 'new device email confirmation' to log into github through selenium.</sub></sup>

- **E2E tests**\
  Upon every push to `main`, and for every PR, and daily on `main` (to check for github-induced regressions) selenium E2E tests are executed.\
  They can be run manually by setting up the selenium environment as defined above and then run `pytest .` in the `browser_control` folder.

- **Unit tests**\
  There's not many unit tests yet (that's still a big todo ðŸ˜„), but the few which are there are run on PRs and pushed to `main`.\
  To run them manually, `npm run test` does the trick.

- **Release**
  Upon tagging a commit, a zip of the dist folder, `unpacked.zip` is added to the corresponding github release.
